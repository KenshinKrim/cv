    <h4>Types of Coffee</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Arabica</em> - You may have seen bags of coffee labeled "100 percent Arabica." Arabica is the most popular type of bean used for coffee. Arabica beans are considered higher quality than Robusta, and they're also more expensive. They result in coffee with a sweeter, less harsh taste.</li>
      <li><em>Latte</em> - This classic drink is typically 1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk, topped with a thin layer of foam, but coffee shops have come up with seemingly endless customizations. You can experiment with flavored syrups like vanilla and pumpkin spice or create a nondairy version by using oat milk. Skilled baristas often swirl the foam into latte art!</li>
      <li><em>Pacamara</em> - is a hybrid created at the end of the 1950s in El Salvador by the Institute for Coffee Research (ISIC). Created by crossing the Pacas variety (an El Salvadoran mutation of Bourbon) with Maragogype and it gets its name from the first 4 letters of each of its parents. It shares traits from both parents.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Hot Coffee</li>
          <li>Iced Coffee</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
